This is the repository for code used by the PhEDEx Web pages. 
It is (currently) divided into two sections; one for the data 
service (Perl) and one for the application server (Python/Bonsai).

The data service uses the consolidated SQL from other parts of 
the project as well as some of it's own (in perl_lib/PHEDEX/Web)
to provide an "API" to the TMDB. It's output will be both a raw 
representation of the database tables and processed information, 
e.g. for use in web pages, plots etc. The data service will also 
be responsible for all writes to the TMDB, and will require 
appropriate security infrastructure. It will follow the coding 
conventions of the consolidation project, and look much like any 
other PhEDEx module. The service will run on Apache with mod_perl. 
Sufficient caching will be set up such that queries aren't 
needlessly rerun. Output will be xml, json and csv.

The application server will be written using the WEBTOOLS Bonsai
framework. It will process the output of the data service to 
produce the necessary pages where needed, and produce the html 
pages themselves (via Cheetah templates). Authentication will be 
provided by the WEBTOOLS framework.
