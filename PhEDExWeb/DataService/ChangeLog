* Changes for 1.4.0

 New APIs:

  * agents - Serves information about running (or at least recently
    running) PhEDEx agents.
  * dashboardhistory - transferhistory for the Dashboard (see below)
  * deleterequests - Serves information about deletion requests,
    including the data requested for deletion, the client who created
    the request, and the clients who approved or disapproved the
    request.
  * groupusage - Serves storage statistics for each node per group.
  * nodeusage - A summary of how space is used on a node.
  * transfererrordetail - Serves transfer error details from the
    database log
  * transfererrorstats - Serves transfer error statistics, the sum
    total of errors per file, block, and link. Note that PhEDEx only
    stores the last 100 errors per link, so more errors may have
    occurred then indicated by this API call.
  * transferhistory - Serves historical statistics about completed
    transfer attempts.
  * transferqueueblocks - Serves blocks in the transfer queue, along
    with their state.
  * transferqueuefiles - Serves files in the transfer queue, along
    with their state.
  * transferqueuehistory - Serves historical statistics about
    transfer queues.
  * transferqueuestats - Serves state details for links currently in
    use.
  * transferrequests - Serves transfer request information, including
    the data requested, the requesting client, the approving clients,
    and the request options.

 Updates to existing APIs:

  * filereplicas - New option 'lfn', for looking up which nodes have
    a file.
  * linktasks API removed, use transferqueuestats instead.

 General changes:

  * Serve an <error> if client certificate is not found in SiteDB,
    instead of serving an HTML sign-up web page.
  * Fix growing /doc path when browsing documentation.
  * Correctly encode unsafe XML characters.
  * For element text data in the XML format, wrap in a CDATA construct
  * Hide 'X' nodes wherever nodes are found, except history APIs
  * Change authn roles for inject, subscribe to 'T0 Operator' of group
    'DataOps'
  * Documentation updates

* Versions < 1.4.0

The data service was born out of a need to integrate with other CMS
services.  The primary APIs were blockreplicas, for turning PhEDEx
into the Data Location Service (DLS), and inect, subscribe, which were
used for automating these actions for the Tier-0.

Original APIs:

  auth			check authentication
  blockreplicas		finds blocks at nodes
  bounce		echos arguments; for testing
  filereplicas		finds files at nodes
  inject		inject data to TMDB from an XML file
  lfn2pfn		convert LFNs to PFNs from TFC in TMDB
  linktasks		task status summary
  nodes			list nodes
  subscribe		make and approve a transfer request from an XML file
  tfc			show the TFC used by a node
