##H   BlockDBSPopulate -state DIRECTORY -db FILE[:SECTION]
##H
##H -state         agent state directory
##H -db            database connection configuration parameter file
##H -log           where to redirect logging information
##H -target_dbs    which DBS to migrate to
##H -migr_command  command to migrate a block in DBS
##H -del_command   command to delete a block in DBS
