=head1 NAME

PHEDEX::Web::API::Shift::RequestedQueued - Requested vs. queued data analysis for shift personnel.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Serves information about current activity in PhEDEx. This module is
specifically tailored to suit the needs of people on shift who are checking
that data is moving properly.

The code implements a check that data requested for a node is indeed being
queued for that node. The check takes several things into account.

First, it gets the number of bytes pending and queued for each node for 
each of the last 12 hours, with timebins aligned on the hour. Then it 
checks the ratio of bytes queued to bytes requested in each timebin, and 
attempts to deduce if the requested data is being queued properly or not.

If no data is requested in any timebin, the queue is declared to be OK, 
and no further analysis is performed.

If some data is requested, but it is less than a preset minimum amount, 
the queue is also declared to be OK. Currently, that minimum is set at 1 
TB. Again, no further analysis is performed.

Next, each bin is checked. The ratio of queued to requested data is 
calculated. If the ratio is less than 10%, the queue is considered to be 
stuck for that timebin. If the ratio is between 0.9 and 5, the queue is 
considered to be OK for that timebin. If the ratio is greater than 5, the 
timebin is considered to be in a warning state, since although data was 
queued the amount requested was far greater than that queued.

If four or more consecutive timebins are stuck, the queue is declared to 
be stuck. If four or more consecutive timebins are in a warning state, the 
entire queue is considered to be in a warning state. If three or more 
consecutive timebins are OK after the queue has been declared stuck, the 
'stuck' state is downgraded to a warning state, since the queue may have 
recently recovered.

N.B. Data for T1 sites, which have a Buffer and an MSS node, are aggregated under the name of the MSS node. 

This algorithm is probably far from perfect. Suggestions on how to improve 
it are welcomed!

=head2 Options

 required inputs: none
 optional inputs: (as filters) node

  FULL             show information about all nodes, not just those with a problem
  NODE             node name, the format for T1 should be like T1_xx%, eg. T1_US_FNAL% to include Buffer and MSS node
