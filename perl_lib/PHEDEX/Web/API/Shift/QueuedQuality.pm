=head1 NAME

PHEDEX::Web::API::Shift::QueuedQuality - Queued vs. quality data analysis for shift personnel.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Serves information about current activity in PhEDEx. This module is
specifically tailored to suit the needs of people on shift who are checking
that data is moving properly.

The code implements a check if queued data is failing or not attempted
for that node. 

It gets the number of bytes pending and queued for each node for 
each of the last 12 hours, with timebins aligned on the hour.
If data was queued in a given hour, and for four hours following that hour 
one of the following is true
 1) quality is below 50%; 2) no blocks appear, nothing was attempted;
Then the node is likely to have a problem, and put into error status.
If quality is below 80%, the node is put into warning status.
If quality is 0, it means the node is trying and failing permanently 
If quality is undef, it means the node is not trying at all

If four or more consecutive timebins are failed, the queue is declared to
be failed. If four or more consecutive timebins are in a warning state, the
entire queue is considered to be in a warning state. If three or more
consecutive timebins are OK after the queue has been declared failed, the
'ERROR' state is downgraded to a warning state, since the queue may have
recently recovered.


N.B. Data for T1 sites, only Buffer node is taken into account. 


=head2 Options

 required inputs: none
 optional inputs: (as filters) node

  FULL             show information about all nodes, not just those with a problem
  NODE             node name, eg. T1_US_FNAL_Buffer, for T1 sites, only Buffer node makes sense since only Buffer node is taken into account

  status             status-code (numeric). 0 => OK, 1 => possible problem, 2 => problem
