=head2 Options

 required inputs:  none
 optional inputs:  (as filters) from, to, block, valid

  from             name of the source node, could be multiple
  to               name of the destination node, could be multiple
  block            block name, allows wildcard, could be multiple
  dataset          dataset name, allows wildcard, could be multiple
  valid            y or n, filter for valid routes. default is either
