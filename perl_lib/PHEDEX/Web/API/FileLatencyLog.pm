=head1 NAME

PHEDEX::Web::API::FileLatencyLog - all about file-level latency for completed block transfers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Return file-level details on latency statistics for completed block transfers
Note that this information is retained in the database for a limited time (default 1 month)

=head2 Options

  required: lfn/block/dataset

  id                    block id
  block                 block name, could be multiple, could have wildcard
  dataset               dataset name, could be multiple, could have wildcard
  lfn                   logical file name, could be multiple, could have wildcard
  to_node               destination node, could be multiple, could have wildcard
  priority              priority, could be multiple
  custodial             y or n, default either
  subscribe_since       subscribed since this time, defaults to 24h ago if block/dataset is not set
  subscribe_before      subscribed before this time, defaults to 24h after subscribe_since if block/dataset is not set
  update_since          updated since this time
  latency_greater_than  only show latency that is greater than this
  latency_less_than     only show latency that is less than this
  ever_suspended        y or n, default neither

 (*) See the rules of multi-value filters in the Core module
