##H Usage: FileDownloadGFALVerify [-c] [-d] [-f] STATUS PFN SIZE CHECKSUM
##H
##H arguments automatically provided by calling agent:
##H    STATUS:        exit code of the transfer process 
##H                   (or "pre" for pre-transfer valiation check)
##H    PFN:           PFN of transfered file to verify
##H    SIZE:          reference size of transfered file
##H    CHECKSUM:      reference checksum of transfered file
##H
##H Verifies that the PFN has been successfully transferred.  The exit
##H code from the transfer program (STATUS) is ignored since the value
##H ends to be unreliable.  Makes sure that size of the transferred
##H file on disk is the same as the one recorded in TMDB (SIZE).  With
##H "-c" option also validates file CHECKSUM if the reference is adler32;
##H otherwise the checksum is ignored if the file size is correct.
##H Finally with "-d" option also always removes the downloaded file
##H after all the checks have been made; this is meaningful only
##H for transfer tests.
##H And as a special goodie hack, with "-f" the return value is forced
##H to be zero (success) -- after all normal checks have been made.
